Contributions
-------------

For small bugs, please just explain the issue and I'll fix the code.

For larger contributions, any code / patches that are submitted must
include a "signing off" indicating that the author agrees with the
`Developer's Certificate of Origin
<http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin>`_ (as used by
Linux) where the licence is as described above.

I will keep contributions separate in the source, along with copyright notices
identifying the contributor.
